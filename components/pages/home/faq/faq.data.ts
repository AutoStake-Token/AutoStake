        question: "What is an elastic supply token? ",
        answer: "Elastic supply tokens have a changing circulating supply. The idea is that instead of the price fluctuating up and down, what changes is the total token supply through events called rebases. This is sometimes surprised to investors because the amount of token in their wallet will fluctuate. But don’t be alarmed. Focus on the market cap and total value of your wallet.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is a Rebase?",
        answer: "A rebase adjusts the total supply of tokens; even those that reside in investors wallets. Let’s say we have an elastic supply token that aims to achieve a value of 1 USD. If the price is below 1 USD, the rebase reduces the current supply, increasing the value of each token so the value always gets closer to the target price."
